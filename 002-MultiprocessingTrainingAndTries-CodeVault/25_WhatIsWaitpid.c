	/*
		- We want to wait first for the Longest Running Process p_id1 (4 seconds).
		- All processes will exeucte this line & wait for the 1'st Child that takes (4 secs to execute)
		- 1st Argument is the process id of the child (which is returned in fork())
		- 2nd Argument is as wait(NULL) or wait(*ptr) ;; pid_t wait(int *wstatus);
			- When you call wait(NULL), you are telling the system that you don't care about the exit
				 status of the terminated child process.
			- When you call wait(&status) (or equivalently, wait(ptr) if ptr is a pointer to an integer),
				 the function will store the termination status of the child process in the variable pointed
				 to by ptr. You can then examine this status using macros such as
				 WIFEXITED(status), WEXITSTATUS(status), WIFSIGNALED(status), etc.
			- pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *wstatus, int options);
				- This is a pointer to an integer variable where the termination status of the child process is stored.
				- Similar to wait(), you can use macros such as WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED, etc.,
					 to interpret the status stored in the variable.
				- If you donâ€™t care about the termination status, you can pass NULL.
		
		- 3rd Argument is telling/specifying How to wait; (0 default)
			- pid_t waitpid(pid_t pid, int *wstatus, int options);
			- This is an integer value that specifies options for the behavior of waitpid.
			- When set to 0, waitpid blocks until the specified child process terminates.
			- You can also combine options using bitwise OR. Common options include:
				- WNOHANG: Return immediately if no child has exited yet.
				- WUNTRACED: Also return if a child has stopped (but not terminated) due to a signal.
				- WCONTINUED: Report if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of SIGCONT.
